## Overview

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). This implementation provides a basic to-do list app with the following features:

2. A tab interface allows users to view all tasks or filter by list.

### User Interface
