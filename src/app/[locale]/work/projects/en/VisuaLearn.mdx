## Overview

VisuaLearn is a comprehensive math and programming teaching website developed in October 2023. The project aimed to create an intuitive and seamless user interface with interactive activities to enhance math learning experiences.

## Key Features

- **User-Centered Design**: Led a team of 5 students in implementing agile systems planning and user-centered design principles to create an intuitive interface.
- **Responsive Web Application**: Engineered a dynamic web application using Flask and Jinja templating engine for a responsive user experience.
- **Secure Authentication**: Integrated a secure user authentication system with SHA-256 password hashing.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Utilized SQLite3 database for efficient storage and retrieval of user data and learning resources.
- **Educational Content Scraper**: Programmed Python scripts to automate the collection of educational resources and structured test questions/answers from online sources.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end**: Flask, Python
- **Database**: SQLite3
- **Authentication**: SHA-256 hashing
- **Additional**: Jinja templating engine, Web scraping

## Challenges and Learnings

The project provided valuable experience in team leadership, agile methodologies, and full-stack web development. Balancing user experience design with technical implementation was a key challenge that fostered growth in both areas.

## Outcome

VisuaLearn successfully delivers a robust platform for math education, featuring an easy-to-use interface, secure user management, and a rich repository of learning materials and practice questions.
